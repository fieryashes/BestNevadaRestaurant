Don't come here expecting anything crazy or gourmet, but do come here expecting a healthy fast food alternative that offers wholesome grilled teriyaki chicken rice bowls or grilled angus steak rice bowls free of frying, skin, MSG, trans-fat, dairy, and HFCS. They also have options that include steamed veggies, tofu and brown rice for the health advocate.\n\nThe food is grilled fresh to order and also the sauce bar they have is very unique. They allow you to take control of your seasonings! They offer \"magic sauce\" which is their version of teriyaki sauce, the \"hot sauce\" is like a frank's red vinegar hot sauce, the \"hot hot sauce\" is a green kick in mouth of spicy deliciousness and is super flavorful. Don't even try dabbling in the hot hot if you can't hang with spice since that bad boy creeps up on you! I'm a spice lover though, so I go for lots of it! I love drizzling a little of everything into my bowl and ask them to top me off with extra green onions and mix it up well - that's the perfect rice bowl packed with flavor! \n\nI've tried other teriyaki bowl spots and I'm always bored since they typically over salt or over sauce the heck out of their food and it doesn't taste that healthy. I like the fact that you can control the sauce/sugar/salt in your bowl here with their convenient DIY sauce bar. Plus the steamed veggies here are never lime green and the protein is not unidentifiable like Yoshinoya. Why are they still open? Yuck. \n\nThe prices are competitive and a great deal; you can snag a tasty grilled white meat chicken rice bowl for under $5 for a mini bowl or under $7 for a regular bowl and none of their bowls or plates are over $10! That's what I like to call cheap eats.\n\nI'm glad they are here! I'll be the one here front and center on those busy days where I need some help meal prepping for a healthy and satisfying protein filled week! \n\nPRO TIP: they are still trying to establish business, so that's why the hours are not set in stone yet.

I've forever heard & read about these legendary West Coast burgers & fries that we Midwesterners are not so privileged to have, but I wanted to try them first hand to see if they are worth the fuss.\n\n1st stop after the rental car nightmare: a mad beeline to the popular Sin City In-N-Out location on Dean Martin Drive near the Strip where I had my very 1st I&O experience! I first noticed all the lovely, adorable palm trees (my fave) by the building & loved them! No palm trees in the mighty Midwest either :-(\n\nI already knew about the cult \"secret menu\" & had my order planned out forever ago! I got a double-double, protein, gem-modified, animal-style: 2 mustard-griddled patties, lettuce-wrapped with cheese, mustard, tomatoes & pickles but held the extra spread & grilled onions. I also got a regular order of french fries & a regular, black coffee because I was exhausted from\u00a0traveling.\u00a0\n\nI always order lettuce-wrapped burgers at restaurants when the option is available like at Five Guys or Red Robin, etc. When I got\nmy meal, I inspected it & it looked like fast food artwork, beautiful! (see my pics)\n\nThe menu says their french fries are fresh cut, but they kinda reminded me of\u00a0McD's fries only a lil thicker with a perfect amount of crispiness & have some potato-like, looking edges. They are completely different than the darker/limper/potatoey/natural-looking, hand-cut 5 Guys kinda fry that I love, but these fries are really friggin' good too, 4 gems!\n\nMy 2 burgers were nicely wrapped with fresh, sliced tomatoes & dill pickles in one large, solid, crisp piece of leaf lettuce with cheese & mustard oozing out of every insanely, tasty bite! That's right, it's messier but OMG more flavorful & juicy than, smh, Five Guys! I never polished a burger, let alone a damn double off that quick in my entire life! I was in burger paradise & still dreamin' about it, um 5 gems!\n\nThis I&O is bright, large, & very clean. For those of you unfortunate enough to have never dined at I&O, you place your order at the counter, your food is made fresh to order, you get a number & they call out your number when your order is ready to pick up at the counter. The staff here was friendly, the place was busy & it took about 15 min to get my food, not so fast but definitely worth the wait!\u00a0Burgers at 5 Guys are never gonna be the same :-(\n\nA lady next to me was eating food from Wendy's, and I didn't even try to hide my disapproving look! How the hell do you eat Wendy's at I&O, the audacity of some people! That's like going to Lou Malnati's in Chicago & bringing in Pizza Hut! I wanted to scream, I don't have I&O by me you ungrateful woman!!\n\nI&O doesn't have free peanuts or all the extra free toppings like 5 Guys. But what they do offer & make are straightforward, kick-ass tasting burgers that don't need all the extra goodies, they have a really cool marketing edge aka \"the secret menu\" & bonus they sell coffee that ain't too bad either! I now get the I&O madness over these gemazing, Wild West burgers!\n\nI came, I saw, I was In (I devoured), I was Out!!

On my first visit the guy behind the counter asked if it was my first time and when I said yes he introduced himself as an owner, Ben, and gave me a sample of their drinks (horchata, jamaica and limon) which were all good. He then gave me a menu to look over and said to just ask if I had any questions. When I was ready to order, Ben asked for my first and last name so that he could put it in his computer because you get a free meal on your birthday. I knew something seemed off about this because he only asked for my name and not my birthday or phone number. While the idea of offering a free meal to a customers is a nice touch, I can only figure there will be several customers with common names making this confusing. When I went back for a second visit the girl who took my order had to scroll through names to find mine taking longer than it really should for that type of thing. Nice perk that could use some tweaking. \n\n#11 Crispy Rolled Tacos ($8) - You can choose chicken or shredded beef and it comes with cheese and your choice of either sour cream or guacamole and comes with a side of rice and beans. I went with shredded beef and asked for guacamole and sour cream, Ben was nice enough to say he'd not charge me for the sour cream this time. The sour cream personally had an odd taste to me, so I scraped off what I could, but the guacamole was pretty good and I saw them making a big batch of it fresh. There was a good amount of cheese on top and the rolled tacos weren't greasy and tasted great. The rice was average tasting to me however the beans with cheese were really good, so I'd ask for double beans next time. Priced right, tasted good and was filling! \n\nBean and Cheese Burrito ($4) - Since the beans with the combo meal I had were good it didn't surprise me to like this burrito. It was was bigger than the picture I posted makes it appear and they didn't skimp on beans or cheese. I'd order this again for sure. \n\nMini Tacos T.J. Style ($6 for 3) - You can chose from chicken, carnitas, asada and al pastor. Ben mentioned the price for this had changed however wasn't updated on the menus yet, so the price might have since changed, but Ben honored the $6 since that's what the menu said and I appreciated that. Just to note... The price is a bit more for lengua. I asked for one each of the chicken, asada and al pastor. The tacos were dressed with cilantro and onion with salsa on the side to add as you prefer. The asada lacked flavor to me however my hubby did have an asada burrito a couple weeks later and when I tried a bite it had good flavor, so maybe I had it on an off day the first time. The chicken was really good and the al pastor had okay flavor once I picked out some of the crispy black bits from the meat. Also I asked for flour tortillas and was told that I could only have corn tortillas for the tacos because the flour ones were for burritos. The corn tortillas came from a bag and as you can see from the pictures I posted they are dry. No bueno. \n\nMulitas ($6) - You can choose the meat you want, I went with carnitas. This wasn't a mula I am used to, it was really big (worth the money for the amount of meat and cheese) and also really greasy. While they certainly didn't skimp with the meat and cheese, the whole thing was just too greasy for me. \n\nYou can place your order online, but on my second visit the line was really insane and the wait was far too long. Yes they make your order fresh however they had a lot of mix-ups that night that was causing the delay. There was a customer who ordered online and they were apparently out of chicken for the tacos she ordered and instead of contacting her to see if she wanted something else they waited for her to show up to ask her about it. The customer ended up placing a whole new order and then someone else that placed an order inside said there food wasn't right when the lady behind the counter opened the food to show them and it had to be remade causing even more of a delay for us waiting customers. On the second visit I waited about 40 minutes and let me tell you seating is limited in the gas station and it gets cramped. There is a few tables/chairs, but as I mentioned it's cramped, so eating inside will just be up to your preference.\n\nThis place is highly rated on Yelp. When I redeemed the check in offer for a free drink the owner accepted it with no problem. He then asked if I was going to write a review and gave me his opinion on Yelp and even called some of the reviewers out by name. I was sorta shocked.

They offer such items like the egg white sandwich cooked with spinach and feta on an English muffin; you can upgrade to a bagel of your choice too for a small up charge. This is on the healthier side. For me I find that since you are claiming to clean up your act while at court; add some bacon to make the day sweeter. The lunch menu is better than some restaurants in the area since this is a little cafe. The pulled pork sandwhich is so moist and the bread that it's cooked on stop it.

No overly soggy or overly crispy noodles were found.\n\n* CRISPY DUCK with PANANG - Crispy duck topped with Thai style red cream curry sauce with cognac:\n- I got this because of Rod U.'s and Chris V.'s review and also because I love crispy duck. The duck was so ridiculously crispy even though it was doing the breaststroke in the most luscious, creamy, decadent, curry sauce.

They have a bar area and a regular restaurant area.  I stopped by and ordered their Nom Nom burger and a Cookies and Cream shake.  Complimentary popcorn is provided to all patrons.\n\nNom Nom Burger ($20) - This consisted of a Kobe beef patty, cheddar cheese, thousand island dressing, and some potato chips, sandwiched between a potato bun.   It also came with a side of fries, which I upgraded to sweet potato fries for $2.50 more.  While the burger was cooked a perfect medium rare per my request,  I was disappointed in the size and considering how much I spent on it, it definitely didn't warrant the price. \n Yes, the burger was juicy, but I would have been perfectly happy with a burger at most of my favorite places for about 1/3 of the price.  The sweet potato fries were disappointing and soggy.\n\nCookies and Cream Shake ($12) - This came with oreo & chocolate chip cookies, a huge chocolate chip ice cream sandwich, dark & white chocolate crunchies, vanilla frosting, and oreo crumbs.  And if that wasn't enough, an extra steel cup was provided with more of the shake.  This shake is designed for at least 2 or 3 people, I don't know what I was thinking when I ordered this.  It was way too much for me, I couldn't finish this.  It was rich, creamy and delicious!\n\nOverall, the burgers here are a major let down and aren't worth the price.  The shakes on the other hand are the real star of the place.

The best worth while bar/restaurant with such quality food and atmosphere. \n\nHappy hour is a treasured time, that time pre dinner that one can get an amazing deal and try the menu in most places. Not even knowing about their happy hour special since it's confusing on their menu. Let's break down the deal I received for my visit. I needed to be burgered. Usually I eat those meat substitute burgers for my protein intake. I am anemic, so when my protein levels drop real low I feel incredibly awful. I know when these spells come on they are similar to those that have low blood sugar levels, since I suffer with this too. I needed that pick me up. I don't cook my own proteins of animal ever at home, I have my own reserved issues here. Been wanting to try here for a while let's see what their burger tastes like.\n\nThe burger deal first with a glass of Rose Champagne cost me $12.00. Incredible too. This burger melted in my mouth it was so juicy. As you bite into it the meat and cheese are one. The meat that this restaurant uses is only top quality anyways with it being inseparably from the Whole Foods. Anything that Whole Foods touches is golden. It does not surprise me that the burger was delicious and refreshing. Usually after one eats a burger they feel fat and lazy come on. I felt the opposite with a burst of energy and joy. Whatever they use to season the burger it's too good to not tell the world, get over here and have one of these burgers. They can burger you either \"true vegan\" style or the traditional kind of way that moo's. Come sample it today with an ice cold beer, chilled glass of wine, or get your celebration on just because with champagne. \n\nThe happy hour libations menu is an amazing deal here. The selection that one has to chose from is where the deal is sweet. Sure if you want Bud Light or a House Wine then this is not the deal that your seeking. If your looking for a beer that maybe you have not tried yet then how about $6.00 a glass or bottle on some, please see the menu for the flavors and styles of beers on the happy hour. The wine and champagne $6.00 glasses is of a higher quality too. This is a Whole Foods so the wine is going to be a wonderful quality. In fact the Rose Champagne is so crisp and I was even asked if I liked it first to ensure it was what I indeed wanted. The bar service here is fantastic. The bartenders are indeed friendly and welcoming ensuring that the customers are cared for, comfortable.\n\nTwo words avocado toast, this is some of my favorite food in the world. The avocado toast here at Whole Foods is so delicious, with sprouts that come over the avocado. Rest assured you know the quality of the food and freshness of the ingredients is of the utmost here. The use of everything organic is passed on though the stores core values. The toast is served on a marble nine grain bread. As you use that fork to cut into the sprouts, the green of the avocado all the way through to the plate it is so smooth and soft. Let's take a bite shall we . The avocado smells so fresh on the fork and full of flavor as it's swallowed. Mmmmmm.\n\nMy reason for staying here wasn't the happy hour menu, that was an incredible perk; but it was the friendly smile from the bartender behind the counter. She gave me that look: \" bars all yours, Sports Center is on, and beer is on tap.\" The proper bartender behind the bar can make or break your business. Never have I been offered a sample of so many beers. The menu here is truly amazing when it comes to IPA beers. Being able to try that beer before buying is even better. Sampling the beer is something they offer to all their customers. Come and celebrate your happy with beer, champagne, or avocado toast. Oh that's my happy. Go beyond with the meatless burger or a real burger too. You decide, know that your psyche will think your being bad, but in your mind know that your doing good.

The employees are your family; or so it seems. Our guide this trip go around was Evette, what a great and attentive individual. Mike and I make quite and entrance together and Evette picked up in that vibe and new friends are made. Who just loves to go to a local \"place\" and know that ya are cared for and appreciated. Over here!\n\nLet's go into some history shall we, class is in. Shhh, get ya pencils ready; PT Golds is owned by Lakes Entertainment, formerly Golden Gaming. Lakes Entertainment provides many wonderful new experiences for dining, entertainment, and gambling in throughout Nevada. This company owns Sierra Golds too. Around the Fall of 2017 Lakes became the largest tavern and slot operator in Nevada, so the company knows their stuff. They are spending a lot to remodel and reopen the \"pub style,\" experience with excellence here in Nevada. Amen, to the old style Smokey Pubs that while were decent, were not great. This is Vegas, and come on its needs to be the best with sparkles and glittery lights. Light and glam aside this pub here keeps it real, with decent eats, family style employees, and sheer exceptional excellence. The company would not stand for anything below average. \n\nAfter a morning of gym and just life, ya know our appetites needed wetting. Being locals, I don't want to drive far so been meaning to try here for a minute, it happened to be today. We sit at one of the booths way in the far west corner and this booth is big for those larger parties or nice and large for when ya want to get intimately close to that \"special,\" someone. Sparks always flying when we show up, so the waitress before we knew,  Evette; and that she was family said she would bring a menu around. Evette has been serving for a minute and has a keen knack for detail; much appreciated in a glitz and glam type town. We ordered iced tea and water, no drinks in the early mornin; today. It's all about breakfast today we had Hamburger and Eggs plate and Typical breakfast platter that consists of bacon, hash browns, toast and eggs; just the basics. As I was ordering those wings were talking to me too; eat me. So, it was breakfast with a side of wings. \n\nWe were so hungry that ya wonder where breakfast went, that was fast. As Mike was eating the Hamburger and Eggs, our girl Evette seemed nervous and just kept coming around; Mike picked up on her off behavior, he's been around a minute. She noticed that he was not eating his burger; it was due to the fact that it was puck style. No one, especially a man that \"needs\" steak daily can put up with dry and tough hamburger. Evette corrected this and even took it off the check without any hesitation. We did not even have to ask. That is the level headed employees and family style individuals that call this establishment their \"job.\" Evette sat up with us and explained that her company is amazing; especially her location. She was employed at the Golds on Cheyenne and needed something closer to home; now she's my guide for all things pub when I stop by. With out meal done and our talk with Evette finished it's time to head home. \n\nY'all come back, that should be their motto. Now here's my issues with Golds, but solvable; even Evette agrees. Golds, ya need steak and eggs; or \"steak\" in some form on the menu. Men need steak. Evette was explaining that this local used to have steak and eggs, but they took it off the menu because it did not sell. So let's help the steak sell, please Golds bring it back. Now Evette was politely reminded us that Sierra's on Eastern, while a four mile drive has some of the best steak around. We will be having this our next visit. This location is so fantastic and here's another reason why. This Golds has been open for a minute. When they closed the T-bird Lounge on Eastern all the employees needed a place to work; where to do ya think they all went. Hmm, how about with the new company location that they are now employed with? The customers that were local to T-birds came too. Mind ya it's a four mile drive for a beer. For the customer to follow , exactly.\n\nLocated right off the I 15 and Cactus, get some gas for your ride and yourself. Evette was my guide to fun and relaxing services, maybe ya will benefit from her vast skills and knowledge too. Locals this is up in our area, with Raiders coming we need down to earth, locally loved establishments to keep us feeling good about living and getting away from the lights and glam of Vegas. For ya tourists, hopefully, understand Vegas is chaos and working with the public ya need a break from that; trust. This is a genius article. After all that driving ya need a good meal maybe a drink that will not cost ya all your money yet.

S. so when we were planning our recent trip to Vegas, all I could hear in my head is Gordon yelling at me, \"You better eat at one of my restaurants, you f***ing donkey!\"   \n\nWith those inspiring words resonating in my head, I booked our first dinner at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=P8fDK-wHe80_9pnT_mIrig ) for Thanksgiving dinner.  This also continued a recent tradition I like to call the \"Untraditional Thanksgiving.\"   It started a few years ago with a trip to Big Bear for a Chinese Thanksgiving and since then we have done Hawaiian and now British cuisine.\n\nOne of the things I like right away was the vibe of the place ... I really felt comfortable and at home.  The attention to detail was extensive including a wall mural ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=0jogkV5ZH0-crkb0wzAzeQ ) , the table settings ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=7PjeahRWVg8XaSlaEYzKMQ ) and menus.  Even the mix matched furniture just felt right in this restaurant.  And if the staff needs a reminder of who they work for ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=mN8dmXYi9mLK3T9tu9vCzg ), you have Chef Ramsay staring at you every time you leave or enter the kitchen!\n\nOnce we were seated at a half booth table, our server came over, took our drink order and introduced us to the menu.  The menu consists of Table Starters, Soups & Salads, Sandwiches & Burgers, Seasonal Choices, Pies, Oak-Fired Grill Entrees, Classic Entrees, Sides and Desserts.\n\nFor my wife, her entr\u00e9e was preordained weeks before the reservation and she chose the Classic Yorkshire Ale Batter Fish & Chips ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=pLeX7KKtxHjHAVxFxtkWIg ) Substituting Mashed Potatoes with Chive Oil for the Chips, I decided to go with the Steak & Ale Pie ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=cxztqT6sQKUcvxwKCUb-dw ) and we split the Kettle Chip Nachos ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=3iew4HO_VJPYKtAeK9t_OA ) Starter item.\n\nThe Kettle Chip Nachos came to the table surprising hot and I think these were the first homemade chips that really impressed Laina.  Usually we would have some major complaints about the lack of short rib (very little) and corned beef (even less ... think nada), but the HP sauce (Tamarind based sauce with tomatoes, molasses and malt vinegar) really elevated the chips and there was a good amount of the other items.  Needless to say and to paraphrase Dr. Suess:  the one speck of food that we left on the plate was a crumb too small for a mouse to have ate!\n\nOur entrees came out shortly after we had wolfed down the nachos.  Laina liked the fish and said she could taste the ale in the batter, but was more impressed with the dill tarter sauce and sides.  Opting out of the chips for mashed potatoes was an excellent choice as the potatoes were perfectly whipped and the chive oil was a great compliment.  Usually Laina will ask for extra butter with her mashed potatoes, but no butter was requested on this occasion.  Her only regret was there could have been more chive oil with the potatoes.  She was also a fan of the mushy peas and thought the vest of lemon was a great addition without being too acidic.\n\nMy steak and ale pie was a well balanced dish, just a bit on the small side.

The employees are your family; or so it seems. Our guide this trip go around was Evette, what a great and attentive individual. Mike and I make quite and entrance together and Evette picked up in that vibe and new friends are made. Who just loves to go to a local \"place\" and know that ya are cared for and appreciated. Over here!\n\nLet's go into some history shall we, class is in. Shhh, get ya pencils ready; PT Golds is owned by Lakes Entertainment, formerly Golden Gaming. Lakes Entertainment provides many wonderful new experiences for dining, entertainment, and gambling in throughout Nevada. This company owns Sierra Golds too. Around the Fall of 2017 Lakes became the largest tavern and slot operator in Nevada, so the company knows their stuff. They are spending a lot to remodel and reopen the \"pub style,\" experience with excellence here in Nevada. Amen, to the old style Smokey Pubs that while were decent, were not great. This is Vegas, and come on its needs to be the best with sparkles and glittery lights. Light and glam aside this pub here keeps it real, with decent eats, family style employees, and sheer exceptional excellence. The company would not stand for anything below average. \n\nAfter a morning of gym and just life, ya know our appetites needed wetting. Being locals, I don't want to drive far so been meaning to try here for a minute, it happened to be today. We sit at one of the booths way in the far west corner and this booth is big for those larger parties or nice and large for when ya want to get intimately close to that \"special,\" someone. Sparks always flying when we show up, so the waitress before we knew,  Evette; and that she was family said she would bring a menu around. Evette has been serving for a minute and has a keen knack for detail; much appreciated in a glitz and glam type town. We ordered iced tea and water, no drinks in the early mornin; today. It's all about breakfast today we had Hamburger and Eggs plate and Typical breakfast platter that consists of bacon, hash browns, toast and eggs; just the basics. As I was ordering those wings were talking to me too; eat me. So, it was breakfast with a side of wings. \n\nWe were so hungry that ya wonder where breakfast went, that was fast. As Mike was eating the Hamburger and Eggs, our girl Evette seemed nervous and just kept coming around; Mike picked up on her off behavior, he's been around a minute. She noticed that he was not eating his burger; it was due to the fact that it was puck style. No one, especially a man that \"needs\" steak daily can put up with dry and tough hamburger. Evette corrected this and even took it off the check without any hesitation. We did not even have to ask. That is the level headed employees and family style individuals that call this establishment their \"job.\" Evette sat up with us and explained that her company is amazing; especially her location. She was employed at the Golds on Cheyenne and needed something closer to home; now she's my guide for all things pub when I stop by. With out meal done and our talk with Evette finished it's time to head home. \n\nY'all come back, that should be their motto. Now here's my issues with Golds, but solvable; even Evette agrees. Golds, ya need steak and eggs; or \"steak\" in some form on the menu. Men need steak. Evette was explaining that this local used to have steak and eggs, but they took it off the menu because it did not sell. So let's help the steak sell, please Golds bring it back. Now Evette was politely reminded us that Sierra's on Eastern, while a four mile drive has some of the best steak around. We will be having this our next visit. This location is so fantastic and here's another reason why. This Golds has been open for a minute. When they closed the T-bird Lounge on Eastern all the employees needed a place to work; where to do ya think they all went. Hmm, how about with the new company location that they are now employed with? The customers that were local to T-birds came too. Mind ya it's a four mile drive for a beer. For the customer to follow , exactly.\n\nLocated right off the I 15 and Cactus, get some gas for your ride and yourself. Evette was my guide to fun and relaxing services, maybe ya will benefit from her vast skills and knowledge too. Locals this is up in our area, with Raiders coming we need down to earth, locally loved establishments to keep us feeling good about living and getting away from the lights and glam of Vegas. For ya tourists, hopefully, understand Vegas is chaos and working with the public ya need a break from that; trust. This is a genius article.

Flavors are well-balanced and it was cooked perfectly. No overly soggy or overly crispy noodles were found.\n\n* CRISPY DUCK with PANANG - Crispy duck topped with Thai style red cream curry sauce with cognac:\n- I got this because of Rod U.'s and Chris V.'s review and also because I love crispy duck.

S. so when we were planning our recent trip to Vegas, all I could hear in my head is Gordon yelling at me, \"You better eat at one of my restaurants, you f***ing donkey!\"   \n\nWith those inspiring words resonating in my head, I booked our first dinner at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=P8fDK-wHe80_9pnT_mIrig ) for Thanksgiving dinner.  This also continued a recent tradition I like to call the \"Untraditional Thanksgiving.\"   It started a few years ago with a trip to Big Bear for a Chinese Thanksgiving and since then we have done Hawaiian and now British cuisine.\n\nOne of the things I like right away was the vibe of the place ... I really felt comfortable and at home.  The attention to detail was extensive including a wall mural ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=0jogkV5ZH0-crkb0wzAzeQ ) , the table settings ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=7PjeahRWVg8XaSlaEYzKMQ ) and menus.  Even the mix matched furniture just felt right in this restaurant.  And if the staff needs a reminder of who they work for ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=mN8dmXYi9mLK3T9tu9vCzg ), you have Chef Ramsay staring at you every time you leave or enter the kitchen!\n\nOnce we were seated at a half booth table, our server came over, took our drink order and introduced us to the menu.  The menu consists of Table Starters, Soups & Salads, Sandwiches & Burgers, Seasonal Choices, Pies, Oak-Fired Grill Entrees, Classic Entrees, Sides and Desserts.\n\nFor my wife, her entr\u00e9e was preordained weeks before the reservation and she chose the Classic Yorkshire Ale Batter Fish & Chips ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=pLeX7KKtxHjHAVxFxtkWIg ) Substituting Mashed Potatoes with Chive Oil for the Chips, I decided to go with the Steak & Ale Pie ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=cxztqT6sQKUcvxwKCUb-dw ) and we split the Kettle Chip Nachos ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=3iew4HO_VJPYKtAeK9t_OA ) Starter item.\n\nThe Kettle Chip Nachos came to the table surprising hot and I think these were the first homemade chips that really impressed Laina.  Usually we would have some major complaints about the lack of short rib (very little) and corned beef (even less ... think nada), but the HP sauce (Tamarind based sauce with tomatoes, molasses and malt vinegar) really elevated the chips and there was a good amount of the other items.  Needless to say and to paraphrase Dr. Suess:  the one speck of food that we left on the plate was a crumb too small for a mouse to have ate!\n\nOur entrees came out shortly after we had wolfed down the nachos.  Laina liked the fish and said she could taste the ale in the batter, but was more impressed with the dill tarter sauce and sides.  Opting out of the chips for mashed potatoes was an excellent choice as the potatoes were perfectly whipped and the chive oil was a great compliment.  Usually Laina will ask for extra butter with her mashed potatoes, but no butter was requested on this occasion.  Her only regret was there could have been more chive oil with the potatoes.  She was also a fan of the mushy peas and thought the vest of lemon was a great addition without being too acidic.\n\nMy steak and ale pie was a well balanced dish, just a bit on the small side.  The pastry was a perfect golden brown and flaky.  This is a very hearty entree and there was a good amount of tender steak, 'shrooms and root veggies.  I am just not sure the quality makes up for the lack of quantity when you consider the price tag ($24.00).  \n\nFor dessert, we selected the Potted Chocolate Triffle ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=4KSMWCaEumIG2DXwpsqF9A ) which came with two mini chocolate chocolate chip cookies.\n\nRohlinism:  It isn't Thanksgiving dinner without a fattening dessert!\n\nLaina was basically full, but always manages to find extra room for chocolaty delicious desserts.  The triffle was topped with white chocolate shavings and round dark chocolate crisps.  The mixture of dark and milk chocolate was fantastic and the Chantilly cream put this dessert on another level!  Fantastic way to end the meal!\n\nService was really good for the most part.  We arrived a few minutes before our reservation and were sat promptly at 7:00 pm (love that British punctuality).  Our server was efficient and answered all our questions (or asked someone who knew), but he could have benefited from a personality transplant.\n\nIt is a bit on the expensive side, but that is to be expected and you can get $1.00 off most items by joining Total Rewards.

The food was just okay for me. The meal was rather forgettable, nothing really stood out enough for me me to say \"I'd order this again!\"\n\nThe dinner service got off on a very rough start when they refused to seat our party of 11. They refused to seat us because 1 out of 11 of us was running late. ONE person out of 11......does that even make any f'kng sense?\n\nThe 2 doctors in our party tried repeatedly to request to the servers and even the manager, but they refused and kept us waiting at the small narrow bar area for almost 45 mins. Some of us got tipsy while waiting for our tables, while most of us just got agitated for having to wait so long. \n\nIt would've been 35 min wait, but the manager seemed to be OCD or unsatisfied w/the table set-up so he made the staff move and rearrange our tables further down from the its original location. Tacking on additional wait time for us at the cramped bar. \n\nAs I said earlier, the food was alright. Nothing spectacular, nothing memorable.\n\nCHICKEN PAIGE ($26.95): \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bjSC_jbrypke0l-bXXBmwQ?select=DFV2Zg8N6ZaECfizTAIddA\nScallopined/thinly cut chicken breasts lightly breaded and pan-fried in a lemon butter sauce. The menu also listed capers and sundried tomatoes cooked into the sauce, but I found cooked down regular tomatoes. No biggie. The portion size was generous and it was tasty. \n\nFRESH FISH A LA NAGE (halibut was the fish special that night, $36.95) \nThe halibut filet was stuffed w/jumbo lump crab meat and served w/baby vegetables. \nI didn't get a chance to take a pic of it, but I was able to steal a couple fork-fulls. \n\nThe under-seasoned halibut was unevenly cooked, some parts were dry and overcooked. \nI'm not so sure if the \"a la nage\" or poaching part was entirely true. \nPerhaps the poaching liquid or \"nage\" was just used to dress the fish after it's been cooked. \n\nJUMBO LUMP CRAB CAKES (1 crab cake for $19.95): \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bjSC_jbrypke0l-bXXBmwQ?select=vMTQgbpbzaTeSUFUAhOp5A\n\nYes, you read that right. It's $19 for ONE crab cake. \nThe crab cake was topped off with additional crab meat and a chive buerre blanc. \n\nFor me, a good buerre blanc should be light and airy, yet rich and thick enough to coat whatever food it's drizzled on. \n\nThis sauce was darker and more orange, I've never seen any buerre blanc (means \"white butter\" in French cooking) that dark before. It looked very similar to the sundried tomato sauce that was in my Chicken Paige dish. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bjSC_jbrypke0l-bXXBmwQ?select=DFV2Zg8N6ZaECfizTAIddA#DFV2Zg8N6ZaECfizTAIddA\n\nBROILED PORTABELLO MUSHROOMS W/RED WINE VINAIGRETTE ($9.95):\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bjSC_jbrypke0l-bXXBmwQ?select=07F2D7XHPQxYjnyOYYg6zw\nDressed w/basil oil, fresh diced tomatoes and \"fresh mozzarella.\" \nThe mozzarella had no flavor and was a bit on the dry side. Some cubes crumbled very easily, almost like feta cheese. \n\nWhen I see \"fresh mozzarella\" on the menu, I'm expecting the cheese to have a higher moisture content, resulting in a more soft to semi-soft cheese. This was not the case. \n\nRAW OYSTERS (6 for $14.95):\nPlump fresh oysters. 'Nuff said.\n\nOYSTERS ROCKERFELLER (6 for $15.95):\nEveryone raves about this dish, so of course we had to get a couple orders for our large party. It was okay. I got chopped herbs, bread crumbs and butter. I wasn't wowed by this dish. \n\nFRIED OYSTERS w/malt vinegar tartar sauce (6 for $11.95): \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bjSC_jbrypke0l-bXXBmwQ?select=NwbMJiBs__-RuwiMIjRLLA\nOut of the 3 oyster dishes, this was the one I was looking forward to. Like the raw oyster and oyster rockerfeller, these fried oysters were also plump and juicy. \n\nThe crust (although very greasy) had a nice crunch to it, but that's where the buck stops. \nThere's nothing more unappetizing than biting into a crunchy fried oyster, only to be disappointed when you find out that you're chewing on some RAW BATTER. \nPerhaps they should go back to the basics and use deep-fryer thermometer? Just a thought. \n\nFRESH SPINACH SALAD ($8.95):\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bjSC_jbrypke0l-bXXBmwQ?select=MWLoXcv3T_MXTLgqCp2Ubg\nThis was a favorite amongst most of us (I only got input from our side of the long table, the other half of our large party didn't mention anything about it). \n\nThis spinach salad had a mixture of chopped bacon, eggs, kalamata olives, and artichokes. That's my kind of salad! Can't go wrong with crispy bacon! The citrus vinaigrette was the perfect addition to the salty bacon and kalamata olives. I enjoyed this dish very much. \n\nIronic that my favorite part of the entire meal was a damn salad.....especially when I don't even like veggies.

Over here!\n\nLet's go into some history shall we, class is in. Shhh, get ya pencils ready; PT Golds is owned by Lakes Entertainment, formerly Golden Gaming. Lakes Entertainment provides many wonderful new experiences for dining, entertainment, and gambling in throughout Nevada. This company owns Sierra Golds too. Around the Fall of 2017 Lakes became the largest tavern and slot operator in Nevada, so the company knows their stuff. They are spending a lot to remodel and reopen the \"pub style,\" experience with excellence here in Nevada. Amen, to the old style Smokey Pubs that while were decent, were not great. This is Vegas, and come on its needs to be the best with sparkles and glittery lights. Light and glam aside this pub here keeps it real, with decent eats, family style employees, and sheer exceptional excellence. The company would not stand for anything below average. \n\nAfter a morning of gym and just life, ya know our appetites needed wetting. Being locals, I don't want to drive far so been meaning to try here for a minute, it happened to be today. We sit at one of the booths way in the far west corner and this booth is big for those larger parties or nice and large for when ya want to get intimately close to that \"special,\" someone. Sparks always flying when we show up, so the waitress before we knew,  Evette; and that she was family said she would bring a menu around. Evette has been serving for a minute and has a keen knack for detail; much appreciated in a glitz and glam type town. We ordered iced tea and water, no drinks in the early mornin; today. It's all about breakfast today we had Hamburger and Eggs plate and Typical breakfast platter that consists of bacon, hash browns, toast and eggs; just the basics. As I was ordering those wings were talking to me too; eat me. So, it was breakfast with a side of wings. \n\nWe were so hungry that ya wonder where breakfast went, that was fast. As Mike was eating the Hamburger and Eggs, our girl Evette seemed nervous and just kept coming around; Mike picked up on her off behavior, he's been around a minute. She noticed that he was not eating his burger; it was due to the fact that it was puck style. No one, especially a man that \"needs\" steak daily can put up with dry and tough hamburger. Evette corrected this and even took it off the check without any hesitation. We did not even have to ask. That is the level headed employees and family style individuals that call this establishment their \"job.\" Evette sat up with us and explained that her company is amazing; especially her location. She was employed at the Golds on Cheyenne and needed something closer to home; now she's my guide for all things pub when I stop by. With out meal done and our talk with Evette finished it's time to head home. \n\nY'all come back, that should be their motto. Now here's my issues with Golds, but solvable; even Evette agrees. Golds, ya need steak and eggs; or \"steak\" in some form on the menu. Men need steak. Evette was explaining that this local used to have steak and eggs, but they took it off the menu because it did not sell. So let's help the steak sell, please Golds bring it back. Now Evette was politely reminded us that Sierra's on Eastern, while a four mile drive has some of the best steak around. We will be having this our next visit. This location is so fantastic and here's another reason why. This Golds has been open for a minute. When they closed the T-bird Lounge on Eastern all the employees needed a place to work; where to do ya think they all went. Hmm, how about with the new company location that they are now employed with? The customers that were local to T-birds came too. Mind ya it's a four mile drive for a beer. For the customer to follow , exactly.\n\nLocated right off the I 15 and Cactus, get some gas for your ride and yourself. Evette was my guide to fun and relaxing services, maybe ya will benefit from her vast skills and knowledge too. Locals this is up in our area, with Raiders coming we need down to earth, locally loved establishments to keep us feeling good about living and getting away from the lights and glam of Vegas.

Well, thanks for Jaburritos, now you can!\n\nThis is my first time ever trying this wildly popular sushi burrito craze and to my surprise, it was great! I had my reservations about eating a giant sushi roll; I feared that the rice would be packed in like a brick, lack flavor, quality fish and enjoyable textures that I've come to love in sushi rolls. Good news, it wasn't a depressing/ soggy rice bomb! I've compared the looks of these to their competitors and I can definitely see the quality ingredients, inventive menu and the presentation offered here. The prep-line carefully added fillings to the burritos like a science! Everything was proportionate and well balanced.\n\nYou have the option to select from their signature Jaburritos menu, which offers a good variety to appeal even to a picky eater! If you feel the courage, you can even create your own, just like you would at Chipotle/ Subway/ Pieology (you get the idea.) They also offer Jabowls which are poke bowls topped with their unique ingredients and they even have Jachos, which are house made taro chips seasoned with angel dust, I would assume, and a side of melted queso. I really loved the taro chips, they were delicately crispy and addictive! I enjoyed dipping the taro chips in their house salsas - really tasty pair! The queso wasn't really anything to write home about; some people refer it to canned cheese, but I thought the combination was interesting.\n\nThe complimentary salsa bar offered a few chunky house made salsas: Mild, Verde, and Roja - none of them being spicy. The flavor of the salsas weren't too pronounced, which is great since it didn't overpower the Jaburrito; the chunky texture and acid added depth to the Jaburrito. I would have to say Verde & Roja enhanced my meal the most! Ginger, wasabi & their house soy sauce (similar to a thick black soy sauce) is also available and these condiments paired well will the Jaburrito.\n\nHere's what I tried: \n\n* Rockport $10.95 - Soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, jalapeno, masago, cucumber, red onion, tempura crunch, chipotle mayo, sweet anguilla sauce. This one was my favorite! Think a burrito sized crunchy roll! The combination of texture and flavor really shined through. I even asked them to add a little bit more sauce and they obliged, making this an explosion of flavor! Rated: 5/5\n\n* Redondo $12.25 - Ahi tuna, salmon, yellow tail, cucumber, masago, red onion, tortilla strips, jalapeno, cilantro, wasabi mayo. This was good, they were generous with the fish and the unexpected crunch from the tortilla chips added a wonderful surprise. Unfortunately, the wasabi mayo was weak on this one, I would probably ask them to add some sweet anguilla sauce or maybe another sauce to wake it up next time! Overall a good Jaburrito option offering fresh fish. Rated: 4/5\n\nThis place is a real hit with the younger crowd & locals; as the word spreads like wildfire, it's only going to get more packed - that line is unrelenting! Also, there isn't much dining room space, so finding seating may prove to be tricky. Crowds aside, I love what they are offering here and I can appreciate the sushi burrito trend.

Hmm. I look back on IG and see one of their Apple Crumble Pie. Whoa. I'm a sucker for crumble anything. Let's go, I said to myself, you need a break.\n\nQuaint. Cute bright ambiance. Very much what I'd envision a corner cafe in France. The owner and girl behind the counter greeted as I scoped out their display. I mentioned the Apple Crumble Pie, since I didn't see it. Walnut Pie today instead as he just put out a limited batch for their first week of opening. Whaaat?!?! Bummer.\n\nI love their tea display, all the leaves in small batches with a clear cylinder top which the owner said I could open. The cylinder captures the aroma of each batch, it smelled heavenly. \n\nI sat down with my Green Tea Passion Fruit and Almond Pie, took some pictures, and just relaxed. The tea was fruity and smoothing, the Almond Pie was light and buttery. I had to restrain and take most of it home. \n\nI'm sure they can put together a box of pastries and cup of coffee to go, but this isn't that type of place. It's one where you sit, sip your latte, chit chat with friends, and enjoy. We don't do that enough, or at least I don't. \n\nI wish I could give it 5 stars, being I'm FTR.

The first was lack of customer service by the hotel staff and the second was with Bacchanal Buffet.\n\nMy wife had done her due diligence regarding Bacchanal ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=bzYtcCHsdE4WrFvoFxCXgw ) coming here before we arrived at Caesars and the reviews indicated it was about a 2 to 2 1/2 hour wait for this buffet so about 1:30 pm the day after Thanksgiving we went to get our ticket with the return time printed on it.  The reviews don't take into account holidays cause the ticket printed out a wait time of 234 minutes (3 hours, 54 minutes) and we were looking at another 1 1/2 hour wait once we were in line.  We had tickets for Mat Franco at 7:00 pm, I did a quick calculation and realized we were screwed!  Bacchanal Buffet does have a way to circumvent both queues and it will only cost you (sarcasm) an additional $25.00 per person.  Since there wasn't a plan B, once again we felt trapped by Caesars and begrudgingly paid the extra money to cut the line.  The total cost for two people ... $175.10 ... with $3.00 per person discount through Total Rewards.\n\nIt took us about another 20 minutes to be seated, our server came over within a few minutes and took our drink orders (a Mimosa for me and a Bloody Mary for the better half).  Both drinks were substandard and Laina said her drink tasted like a can of V-8 sans alcohol.\n\nThe buffet itself is extremely large and includes Mexican, Italian and Asian cuisines, but the seafood section seems the most popular.  My lovely wife saw several diners walking around with plates piled high with crustaceans:\n\n( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=ZF6BB097jqEmXYpJXovzOQ )\n\n( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=pML-RoDrE1Qw9u-Bop7roA )\n\nI sampled the shrimp (twice) and it was fresh and of good size, but they were no better than the shrimp I have eaten at other buffets.\n\nThe Peking Duck (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=SGnzFIpaDrJ4MB2_WB39IA  ) in the Asian section was pretty good and the plum sauce complimented the duck well, but it would have been nice if they had deboned the duck, some of the small pieces could cause someone to choke.  Laina had some of the ramen and what was the word she used ... ah ... disgusting!  She had one sip and never touched it again.  \n\nAs other reviews have pointed out, one of the shocking strengths of this buffet is the pizza ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=dK1z7jJJW-rHZu7Xa3jTXw ) in the Italian section.  It had an excellent sauce and there was a good amount of pepperoni on each slice.  The Italian section also produced one of the worst lamb chops I have ever sampled.  These chops were tough and fatty ... two words that should never be used to describe lamb!  Each us tried a chop and neither of us came close to finishing it.  I thought the pears and walnuts ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=T2c9PchyncstrmuEJmj0rA ) side was a little overcooked, but the flavor would have went well with the chops had they had been edible.  The pumpkin gnoochi ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=vPEtBfMmIvDdz-JWtmsK8A ) was good, but didn't really have a \"wow\" factor.\n\nThe Mexican section also was really strong with their freshly made tortillas ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=-SGS6A4FkFgoPOrdezHbYQ ) and choice of carne asada, al pastor and el pollo for your tacos.  The salsa and condiment section ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=rHAxXwRiddShZ5mWbyXA4Q ) was extensive with plenty of fresh choices to finish off your tacos.\n\nAnother item on the more disappointing side was the prime rib.  The gentleman carving the prime rib had more personality than the slices of meat he was serving up.  The roast was cooked to proper temperature, but one bite and we could tell the quality of meat and seasoning was lacking.\n\nRohlinism:  Your server should never be spicier than the food he / she is serving!\n\nThe dessert selection was also extensive and there were a few hits here between the crepes section ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=IxPCXOf-wN25UU3PjqyH-w ) and the chocolate lava cake (the better half had at least two cakes).  Most of the rest of the dessert section seemed to be the standard buffet fare.  The crepe section was lacking chocolate sauce, which was disappointing to the better half.\n\nService was actually on the poorer side even for a buffet and there was long pauses between glasses being refilled, although plates were removed in a timely manner.\n\nI wouldn't recommend going to this buffet during the holidays and it is probably not even worth the wait time during a normal week.

When I think of really good food Italian cuisine comes to for thought. The idea of delivering delicious \"real\" food was the fruition of the chef who made this happen.\n\nItalian cuisine evokes a place that is comforting it wraps one up in that favorite blanket and holds them close. It is a feeling of closeness and tenderness that I feel as we got close to this cafe. \n\nLocated in Caesars Palace as you come through the main entrance where check in is located for hotel guests; take the first hallway all the way around (not towards Omni, the other way) it's on the right. It's set up cafe style as I said earlier, while many patrons were stopping by for real good food to go, some opt to stay as we did! \n\nAs I approached Pronto I was blown away by all of the precious detail that was included in the dining room decor, plus the wonderful selection of delicious choices and flavors of beverages just to start with. Let's start in the lobby, while it's not the biggest place to sit, it's size is comparable to a Starbucks lobby is anywhere USA. The chairs and tables are decorated in a beautiful pattern with bright orange. It screams luxury and then we must sit and see if the seat is just as comfortable as it should be. Coziness achieved the seats are ready for one to enjoy your favorite app or instagram posting, game with a cappuccino or glass of wine. \n\nPeace even if just for a minute or too is hard to find in Las Vegas, especially inside one of the busiest hotels in the world. Pronto is tucked in the back of Caesars with very little if not any gambling casino games to destroy your zen while sipping cappuccino trying to achieve Nirvana! The chairs and booth seats are all comfy just waiting for you to stop by! As I sat here I enjoyed the satisfaction of silence here. The ambiance of the place that is was created is utter repose and a fantastic escape from the casino and noise. \n\nWhile I was browsing the food, the many choices it's way too hard to choose from. If you enjoy sparkling water and upscale luxury dining with having not to make a reservation this is the place to visit. They are over stocked with some of my favorites such as Fentimans Rose Lemonade or Pellegrino Sparkling Water. The food selection is as abundant as their beverage selection. The line is set up where you start at one end and grab and go what you need as you move in line. The selection of food behind the counter is such items as simple sandwiches, pasta, Italian favorites to make one feel good and happy with delicious flavors filling them up. As one nears the register the gelato is the last delicious item and oh so tempting! \n\nAs I paid for my sandwich, cheesecake, and sparkling water I am elated with the speed and quality of the front counter service. The cashiers are speedy and very professional. They smile and are so very warm. It's nice to have a cashier that's happy while they are working and interacting with their fellow employees! The crew of Pronto are amazing! Thumbs up to some of the best team work that I have seen in some time . While I was paying for my purchases the manager was restocking the water, she wished me a blessed day without me even speaking to her. This is the kind of presence of team work that should be the blueprint for every company. When the crew and customers are happy then it's smooth sailing. Cruise in and come see how a proper ship is run!\n\nDesert is always first or at least a bite! Wanting to try the cheesecake so much I opened the container and inserted the fork. Here we go real Italian cheesecake. The bite of the cheesecake was not good enough to make a decision if it was good; it took three bites. Yes, the cheesecake here is a wonderful winner! The cheese is so smooth and delectable. I'm not much for crust, but the graham crackers were delicious with perfect balance to the cheesecake pairing together. The sandwich that I had was a fantastic wonder of salami, pepperoni, and provolone cheese served warmed. The sensation from the cheesecake was still filling me with warm fuzzy joy! The sandwich was awesome but compared to the cheesecake it does not hold up. Eventually, I will try everything on the menu. \n\nNow with my visit coming to a close I want to thank Pronto for the free Yelp check in they provide to us. The check in was a fantastic lemon cookie with three in a package. These lemon cookies are no joke, really they are amazing; especially with sparking wine!

I first went to the ladies room and in the handicapped stall with the baby changing table there was no toilet seat covers (first ding).  Ok, so I used toilet paper instead.  After using the restroom, I wanted to order our breakfast and there was a long line with only 1 cashier working.  I have a squirmy toddler that wants to run a muck and this line was moving like the DMV!  Even the guy infront of me who worked at Trader Joe's was getting frustrated on how slow this line was moving.  Finally, another cashier came on board and helped the Trader Joe's guy.  It's now my turn to order.  The cashier asked for my phone number to look up my Panera rewards.  I had to repeat my phone number three times to her before she got the number right (and I wasn't saying my number fast) meanwhile I'm trying to show her the email on my phone that says I get a free breakfast sandwich AND my toddler still wants to run a muck and I'm holding on to her by a thread.  By this time, I'm extremely frustrated only to have the cashier tell me that yes, I do have a breakfast sandwich due to me however, breakfast time is over. I LOST IT!  I drove 8 stinking miles to this Panera because it's the closest one to me to try and claim my free breakfast sandwich with my antsy toddler only to be told that breakfast time is over?!?!

I feel that Panera should serve breakfast all day long.  It's not like they have that big of a menu that they couldn't.  I believe that Corner Bakery serves breakfast all day long.  After a few choice words came out of my mouth, the cashier double checked with the supervisor or manager and confirmed that they are no longer serving breakfast.  They did not try to make the situation better.  They did not offer a free lunch sandwich instead for my troubles or any sort of compensation to make this very frustrating situation better.  They let me walk out pissed and that was a very bad move on their part.  Hence, why I'm writing this review.  I was a Panera fan.

I ordered their popular slut as well as their fairfax sandwich.

The presentation was unique.  Using a plastic spoon I scooped out some of the potato puree and coddled egg and spread it on the baguette.  The runny yolk, egg white, and potato puree spread nicely on the crispy baguette.

I've forever heard & read about these legendary West Coast burgers & fries that we Midwesterners are not so privileged to have, but I wanted to try them first hand to see if they are worth the fuss.\n\n1st stop after the rental car nightmare: a mad beeline to the popular Sin City In-N-Out location on Dean Martin Drive near the Strip where I had my very 1st I&O experience! I first noticed all the lovely, adorable palm trees (my fave) by the building & loved them! No palm trees in the mighty Midwest either :-(\n\nI already knew about the cult \"secret menu\" & had my order planned out forever ago! I got a double-double, protein, gem-modified, animal-style: 2 mustard-griddled patties, lettuce-wrapped with cheese, mustard, tomatoes & pickles but held the extra spread & grilled onions. I also got a regular order of french fries & a regular, black coffee because I was exhausted from\u00a0traveling.\u00a0\n\nI always order lettuce-wrapped burgers at restaurants when the option is available like at Five Guys or Red Robin, etc. When I got\nmy meal, I inspected it & it looked like fast food artwork, beautiful! (see my pics)\n\nThe menu says their french fries are fresh cut, but they kinda reminded me of\u00a0McD's fries only a lil thicker with a perfect amount of crispiness & have some potato-like, looking edges.

The #1 Fuku Burger is an all-beef \"Fukupatty\" with American cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, and topped with wasabi mayo and Fuku sauce. It was cooked perfectly and full of flavor. I mainly had the Naga Dog which is a 1/3lb. hot link topped with grilled kimchi, daikon relish, wasabi mayo, spicy kabayaki sauce, and topped harinori strips. Minus the kimchi being in huge awkward slices [I think I would have preferred it to be chopped up], it was really good! All the buns for the burger and the hot dog were toasted so props!

It took 60+ visits for me to come on here and officially proclaim: Bachi Burger is the best burger joint in town.\n\nI read all of the 3 star and below reviews and I feel sad for those reviewers.  Not because they don't have good taste, but because they clearly haven't experienced the Bachi that I've come to know and love over the years since it opened.  I will say that even though I am blessing it with 5 stars, I've definitely had moments where I questioned that rating, be it from visits where I experienced awful service, undercooked burgers, or the terrible, terrible practice of their writing down my credit card info every time I make a take-out order.  All of those are forgiven though for me due to the 85% of the time when everything is flawless.\n\nI've had almost everything on the menu.  My absolute favorite order is the Black and Green burger.  When they nail it, they absolutely nail it.   The Wagyu beef, bacon, blue cheese, spinach and mushrooms all form together like Voltron to make one of the best burgers I've ever had.  But there are 70 other reviews where you can read about that.   I also really like the Lonely Bird when I'm not feeling like red meat, which isn't too often.   Miyagi San, Banh-Mi, Ronin, all solid as well and belong in my rotation.   \n\nOne thing I rarely see mentioned or see people take advantage of is the build your own burger feature.  I've actually had several times just a straight up Bachi Burger with a Wagyu patty which comes standard with Lettuce, Tomato and Onion and anything else you want, but it doesn't even need anything else.  It's nice to know that they're not just putting lipstick on a pig, or in this case, a cow, and that the meat can stand on its own.  \n\nI hinted earlier at undercooked burgers and I will say that in my experience Bachi tends to cook on the lower end of the spectrum.   Medium-Rare which is how I would normally like it has come out too rare for me and Medium often comes out the way I'd normally expect Medium-Rare.   So I stick with medium for the most part. \n\nFor fries they do a decent sweet potato fry, and oddly enough I just don't get the hype over the oxtail chili cheese fries even though I've had them 5-6 times, once done over sweet potato fries which I think is a special order type thing.   Fries, oxtail meat, and egg sounds like my death row last meal, but each time I found them underwhelming and prefer to just go the Salt and Pepper Garlic french fry route.   The fries aren't at all what keeps me coming back here and I'd like to see them experiment more with different varieties, but it seems to be the same ones from the first day I went there and I'm guessing that won't change anytime soon.\n\nDrink-wise they do a mean sake sangria which I find irresistible, although pricey and they have Rogue Hazelnut ale, so I'm normally happy either way.   \n\nService can be inconsistent, usually due to how it's ALWAYS BUSY, but there are several very solid individuals who work there at the moment and they treat the Duke with respect, as they should.", "sentiment_analysis": "[Positive: 0.852]"}, "tip": {"stars": 5, "useful": 4, "funny": 4, "cool": 5, "text": "This place is amazing- simply.

Not only that but I have dreams of their burger desserts: the first one is a Nutella patty on a donut bun with passion fruit gelatin, kiwi and strawberries- the second is a donut bun with a cheesecake custard and pineapple slice (it tastes like an pineapple upside down cake). \nIt can get VERY pricey if you don't watch what you are doing. You can build your own burger and shake if you want, but BEWARE- it will be more expensive to do so than if you go with their featured foods. \nExample: the Nutella milkshake was 7.00 (all milkshakes are, but for the Salted Caramel which is 8.75), if I wanted to make my own the ice cream to start with is listed as 7.00.

It also came with a side of fries, which I upgraded to sweet potato fries for $2.50 more.  While the burger was cooked a perfect medium rare per my request,  I was disappointed in the size and considering how much I spent on it, it definitely didn't warrant the price. \n Yes, the burger was juicy, but I would have been perfectly happy with a burger at most of my favorite places for about 1/3 of the price.

I obliged the manager and provided his certification although I had already stated I did not need to.\nUpon him seeing it, he said he needed an ASPCA card and some other form of ID. I explained that neither of them are covered by ADA and he then stated that His establishment (Holstein's) didn't recognize dogs for \"Stress Disorders.\"\n \nAt this point, I had become highly agitated, not to mention embarrassed by the continuing debate and had some choice words with him about sacrifice and losing friends.\nHe had to step away for a moment and I took that moment to apologize to a couple at the table next to us and they felt I was in the right. Their daughter has a service animal as well and knew the rigors I was going through.  \n \nThe manager then returned with an email he was basing his reasons for having me leave the restaurant.  In trying to placate me he made mention that his father was in Vietnam and supports vets. Yet still I was being kicked out and had not in fact, broken any laws.\n* A person with a disability cannot be asked to remove his service animal from the premises unless:\no (1) the dog is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it\nor  \n\no (2) The dog is not housebroken. When there is a legitimate reason to ask that a service animal be removed, staff must offer the person with the disability the opportunity to obtain goods or services without the animal's presence.\n* Establishments that sell or prepare food must allow service animals in public areas even if state or local health codes prohibit animals on the premises.\n \nI left your establishment quite appalled and publically embarrassed, as were my friends. I apologized to the manager for yelling at him after my dog calmed me down and kept me from becoming too excited.\n \nI trust this is not the way that Holstein's Shakes & Buns, wishes to conduct business with valued customers.  As a veteran, I have never encountered such treatment before.\n \nI ask that you understand that service dogs are a protected entity and that your manager needs to recognize that as such.

After seeing the affordably priced lunch specials they have on the menu and being the true foodies we are, we ended up picking out 4 different lunch specials to share between the both us. Inside is clean and the staff is very friendly. Red Moon is near CSN and can get really busy at lunch time. They were packed when we walked in, but they kept the line moving smoothly and while seating was limited due to them being busy, we actually ended up scoring the best table right next to the clear partition where we could see the pizzas being made. \n\nLunch Specials are currently Mon-Fri 11am - 4pm and include a fountain drink.\n\nMeatball Sub ($4.99 lunch special) - The meatball sub comes with cheese and bell peppers and onions are optional and no extra charge. The sub arrived open-faced. The bread which is made in house, was very good! The meatballs were crumbled instead of in balls which I don't mind and while there was good flavor, there just wasn't enough meat for the amount of bread. \n\nMushroom Pizza ($4.99 lunch special) - I really liked this. The crust was perfectly crisp on the very bottom yet fluffy on the top and I love that they use fresh mushrooms instead of canned. The sauce is very good and I'd for sure order this again. \n\nWhite Pizza ($4.99 Lunch Special) - Cheese was not skimped on with this one! Again the crust was on point, but the one thing lacking was garlic. I noticed all the fresh and quality ingredients being used here at Red Moon, so I was really surprised to see a container of powdered garlic salt that they were using (though garlic wasn't on this pizza I just noticed the container) when fresh garlic is so affordable. This white pizza was very cheesy, delicious and worth ordering, but my friend and I both agreed it was missing garlic.  \n\nCombo Calzone ($4.99 Lunch Special) - This was very good. The dough tasted great and there was a good amount of cheese, sauce and toppings inside. This is definitely worth trying if you haven't yet and the lunch special price is more than fair for what you get. \n\nThe pizzas also come in medium and large size and they also have wings, salads and cold sandwiches on the menu.", "sentiment_analysis": "[Positive: 0.855]"}, "tip": {"text": "Located on the 3rd floor!!- hidden in an alleyway!

I never like to start reviews on the negative, but with all the chaos that has happened;  it's necessary chaos. I find that darkness cannot trump the light, so explaining the positivity about Marco's at the end will release the bad to the universe to be healed!\n\nLast night the twins and dogs gave me those eyes, so I gave in as long as it was delivery and pizza! With no arguments I decided Marco's again since it was so great before and inexpensive! Last night the pizza could of been free and would not of bothered me! I ordered two medium pizza with two toppings for $6.99 each; which is an internet special on Marco's website. On those two pizzas I choose pepperoni and sausage for the toppings, which was prepaid for on my credit card for delivery. The other two occasions in the last two weeks where I ordered delivery had no issues. The driver brought the pizza to my door and everything. Check this out I can laugh about it now, but last night it pushed my buttons!\n\nSupposed Marco's Pizza has changed their delivery procedures and not informed the hungry customers. I received a phone call from the driver asking me what building I was located in, ok not surprising! Then the Marco's delivery lady calls me again and said she's by the pool come get your pizza. I replied no, I'm right down in the next building from the pool. Ok, third and final call: the delivery individual indicates she has found my building and to come get my pizza. She was not polite, in fact her tone made me go what did you just say! I called her politely and asked her to elaborate the last command she gave me! The driver then went into a spiel about how it's the company's policy to have \"the customer,\" come and get their own pizza; for the drivers protection! Wanting to get my pizza before tomorrow, I inform her I need to find outdoor clothing to put on. She said she's parked outside. \n\nTaking me a little time to dress and for the cold and dark I don't find the car outside since my complex's parking lot is full of cars. I call the driver again and ask where she is parked! She instructed me a teal green Taurus, still not seeing this car; it's dark too. The driver gets out of the door and waves us over since it is apparent we are looking for something; yeah my pizza. She gives me the pizza and I thank her for at least bringing it, even though I ordered delivery. I commented that other drivers from their restaurant, just last week brought it to our door; wanting to know how \"new\" this policy is. I also commented on the stupidity of their drivers safety protocols for the employees safety. She was a female what happens if someone pushed her in the car and robbed the driver. Or does Marco's not care about their customers safety? Who knows? When I find out I will elaborate more and pass on it on!\n\nSafety concerns not delivering the pizza to the door due to safety for the delivery driver! I cannot make this up. Either this particular driver was crafty at stretching the truth or lazy; maybe both! If I call Marco's it may go bad and unprofessional on the phone, since when I called the store after calming down I was told the manager was busy. I'm not going to chase the manager. Another few thing that made it even worse was the fact that made it worse I just had surgical procedure this morning at UMC and cannot get up and cook for the twins. Plus the pizza was cold and shaken up with the pepperoni all messy. How puerile it would be for this to be the new Marco's delivery policy? Wow, when I order delivery I at least expect it to come to the door, especially since I already paid for it! What are we gonna rob our own pizza? No, so I'm not sure if you should trust \"delivery\" here, it might be easier if you carry out, or try somewhere else!\n\nNow the first two prior visits were excellent and flawless. I ordered online at Marco's website using the 2 topping 2 medium pizzas with no issues. One time was pepperoni and cheese; another time pepperoni and mushroom. Both arrived hot and delicious. The bonus was these pizza delivery's were brought to my door too. Crazy right for delivery! The pizza both these times were so good. The cheese so hot and just cooked that it pulled apart as I took a bite. Yeah hot and cheesy the only way to eat pizza.

The bread truly makes the sandwich, no expense spared the incredible ingredients that make up the brioche Rolls brings out the excellence of that chicken every time.

The shrimp is fresh and oh so yummy. As I bit into that shrimp it blew my mind so. The tail and shrimp parting ways in my mouth went so smoothly, and no cocktail sauce needed; it would ruin the shrimp. It just melts into greatness as it is digested. \n\nThe service here is incredible with so much joy as the servers and staff move in between the tables.

In addition, I was even more surprised at the PRICE! Everything on the menu is so reasonable! \n\nAfter debating among the options on the menu, I decided to go for the Shepard's Pie.  My friend, Carol, ordered a pasta dish. I did notice while we were waiting for our order that there were customers at the front desk who were waiting to be greeted/seated. They were unattended for some time, and I did see a previous review mention that issue. We didn't have that problem, but I did witness it. Maybe they just need to let their staff know?? Idk..\n\nAnyway, my Shepard's Pie was huge and it was also very tasty. The biscuit portion was light and flaky. Also, the meaty interior of it was hearty and filled with fresh vegetables. I couldn't finish half of it. It truly could have fed two adults in my opinion! My friend reported her pasta tasted good, and she enjoyed the shrimp she added to it. We were both way too stuffed to order any dessert, but we did enjoy our lunch. Overall, I'd recommend stopping by here if you're in the area. \n\nP.

As amazing as it was the first time, this second Momofuku adventure blew me away. It could have been because we were seated at the most exclusive table in house. It might be because we were welcomed instantly with a glass of bubbly ros\u00e9. Or maybe it was because I was spoiled senseless as the birthday girl but what a crazy night --- Three hours of nonstop gluttony with some of my most favorite people in the world.\n\nAfter the beautiful glass of ros\u00e9, a dish of birthday oysters were presented. \"Other places do the cheesy $0.80 dessert. We do things differently here...\" I felt like my soul was being flirted with. Blow out the candle, squeeze on some lemon, a quick oyster cheers with the table, and down it goes. Fresh, oceanic, and clean. I was instantly hungry for more.\n\nAfter that was a gorgeous plate of bigeye tuna with french strawberries and shaved foie gras.

Easily one of my favorite bites. It was refreshing.\n\nMiso sea bass with crab butter, mushrooms, and roasted vegetable broth topped with thick generous slices of truffles.

It's hard to say what was my favorite bite of the night but this dish was definitely one of the most memorable. The truffles worked insanely well in this dish. So fragrant and well balanced.

The best worth while bar/restaurant with such quality food and atmosphere. \n\nHappy hour is a treasured time, that time pre dinner that one can get an amazing deal and try the menu in most places. Not even knowing about their happy hour special since it's confusing on their menu. Let's break down the deal I received for my visit. I needed to be burgered. Usually I eat those meat substitute burgers for my protein intake. I am anemic, so when my protein levels drop real low I feel incredibly awful. I know when these spells come on they are similar to those that have low blood sugar levels, since I suffer with this too. I needed that pick me up. I don't cook my own proteins of animal ever at home, I have my own reserved issues here. Been wanting to try here for a while let's see what their burger tastes like.\n\nThe burger deal first with a glass of Rose Champagne cost me $12.00. Incredible too. This burger melted in my mouth it was so juicy. As you bite into it the meat and cheese are one. The meat that this restaurant uses is only top quality anyways with it being inseparably from the Whole Foods. Anything that Whole Foods touches is golden. It does not surprise me that the burger was delicious and refreshing. Usually after one eats a burger they feel fat and lazy come on. I felt the opposite with a burst of energy and joy. Whatever they use to season the burger it's too good to not tell the world, get over here and have one of these burgers. They can burger you either \"true vegan\" style or the traditional kind of way that moo's. Come sample it today with an ice cold beer, chilled glass of wine, or get your celebration on just because with champagne. \n\nThe happy hour libations menu is an amazing deal here. The selection that one has to chose from is where the deal is sweet. Sure if you want Bud Light or a House Wine then this is not the deal that your seeking. If your looking for a beer that maybe you have not tried yet then how about $6.00 a glass or bottle on some, please see the menu for the flavors and styles of beers on the happy hour. The wine and champagne $6.00 glasses is of a higher quality too. This is a Whole Foods so the wine is going to be a wonderful quality. In fact the Rose Champagne is so crisp and I was even asked if I liked it first to ensure it was what I indeed wanted. The bar service here is fantastic. The bartenders are indeed friendly and welcoming ensuring that the customers are cared for, comfortable.\n\nTwo words avocado toast, this is some of my favorite food in the world. The avocado toast here at Whole Foods is so delicious, with sprouts that come over the avocado. Rest assured you know the quality of the food and freshness of the ingredients is of the utmost here. The use of everything organic is passed on though the stores core values. The toast is served on a marble nine grain bread. As you use that fork to cut into the sprouts, the green of the avocado all the way through to the plate it is so smooth and soft. Let's take a bite shall we . The avocado smells so fresh on the fork and full of flavor as it's swallowed. Mmmmmm.\n\nMy reason for staying here wasn't the happy hour menu, that was an incredible perk; but it was the friendly smile from the bartender behind the counter. She gave me that look: \" bars all yours, Sports Center is on, and beer is on tap.\" The proper bartender behind the bar can make or break your business. Never have I been offered a sample of so many beers. The menu here is truly amazing when it comes to IPA beers. Being able to try that beer before buying is even better. Sampling the beer is something they offer to all their customers. Come and celebrate your happy with beer, champagne, or avocado toast. Oh that's my happy. Go beyond with the meatless burger or a real burger too. You decide, know that your psyche will think your being bad, but in your mind know that your doing good.

Having so many dining experiences under my belt, perhaps I shouldn't be so impressed by Picasso, but I cannot help myself from gushing over Picasso's charming dining room with its vaulted ceilings and astonishing view of the Bellagio's dancing fountains. I certainly will not ever dine in another restaurant outfitted with original works from Pablo Picasso, including the \"Seated Man,\" a self-portrait painted in 1965 that overlooks the dining area, and the priceless \"Woman With Beret,\" one of Picasso's trademark distorted cubist figures created in 1938.\n\nOf course, this is a restaurant in addition to an art exhibit, and James Beard-awarded \"Best Chef\" Julian Serrano is a rare celebrity chef who still does honest work for a living and can actually be found in Picasso's kitchen on most nights. I put myself at his mercy with the \"Menu D\u00e9gustation\" and thoroughly enjoyed the ride.\n\nMy first bite of food was their phenomenal amuse bouche, a crispy \"Pheasant Croquette\" with delightful strips of prosciutto and a mushy filling of minced meat mixed with gooey melted cheese, accompanied by a nutty \"Chilled Potato and Leek Soup with Sliced Almonds\" that tasted like the essence of leeks amplified by a thousand.\n\nMy favorite course of the evening was the earthy \"Roasted Tenderloin of Colorado Lamb,\" seasoned perfectly, cloud-tender, and served on a scorching hot plate (think Ruth's Chris). I don't mean to undersell the plump \"U-10 Day Boat Scallops,\" seared to pick up a brown crust and then placed on top of a buttery potato mousseline surrounded by a glorious jus de veau gravy. And what kind of grand meal (outside of California) would this be without a foie gras course? Here, a \"Saut\u00e9ed Foie Gras Steak\" is served with chocolate-stuffed Olson cherries in a silky green peppercorn sauce infused with more foie gras. The contrasting sweet, sour, savory, and spicy notes work to elevate this to a work of edible art congruent with the theme of the restaurant.\n\nService from my waiter was flawless, even if not as personalized as I've had in other Forbes 5-Star/AAA 5-Diamond spots. The supporting cast was excellent, however. The \"Bread Guy\" was perhaps the highlight, at one point scurrying out of the kitchen over to my table with agility and purpose to breathlessly announce to me, \"the 'Bacon and Onion Bread' is fresh from the oven.\" He understood me in a way that few other people ever have. I thought the \"Green Olive Bread\" was going to be the best thing he laid before me, but \"Bread Guy\" kept nudging me towards the baguette, even as I repeatedly passed it up. I finally succumbed and was rewarded for it with a crunchy, crackly crust, an interior both airy and lightly chewy, a perfect bit of salt, a pleasant amount of sweetness. Immediately upon my finishing it, he was at my side again to drop more bread on me. \"Bread Guy\" was awesome, even if he was diabolically trying to stuff me with bread until I exploded.\n\nDessert was Picasso's \"Warm Chocolate Fondant,\" a dish that has been on the menu every day since the restaurant opened, and rightly so. Yes, it's a chocolate lava cake, but the best you will ever have, and with a sphere of rocky road ice cream featuring massive melted marshmallows. In other words, the type of dessert that was made with me in mind.

My favorite bites were the Baked BBQ Pork Buns, the Steamed Pork Spare Ribs with Black Bean Sauce (so juicy!), the Steamed Pork Dumplings with Shrimp (Siu Mai), the Steamed Shrimp Dumpling (Har Gow), and the Braised Chicken Feet with Abalone Sauce.  \n\nI didn't care for the Steamed Wagyu Bundle with Green Apple and Mushroom (good balance of flavors but very clunky and troublesome to eat), the Steamed Abalone with Chicken in Mantou Cup (surprisingly bland), and the Deep Fried Shrimp Toast with Black Truffle and Foie Gras Sauce (would be good if it wasn't so oily and greasy). The Deep Fried Bean Curd with Shrimp, Steamed Bean Curd with Meat and Shrimp, Pan-Fried Turnip Cake, and Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf were okay but nothing remarkable. Everything was washed down with some guk bou cha (\u83ca\u666e --- Pu'er Chrysanthemum tea) which really helped with the greasy fried foods.\n\nThere were a lot of tasty bites, friendly service, and constant refills. This place runs like a well-oiled machine. Tim Ho Wan is impressive!

Having so many dining experiences under my belt, perhaps I shouldn't be so impressed by Picasso, but I cannot help myself from gushing over Picasso's charming dining room with its vaulted ceilings and astonishing view of the Bellagio's dancing fountains. I certainly will not ever dine in another restaurant outfitted with original works from Pablo Picasso, including the \"Seated Man,\" a self-portrait painted in 1965 that overlooks the dining area, and the priceless \"Woman With Beret,\" one of Picasso's trademark distorted cubist figures created in 1938.\n\nOf course, this is a restaurant in addition to an art exhibit, and James Beard-awarded \"Best Chef\" Julian Serrano is a rare celebrity chef who still does honest work for a living and can actually be found in Picasso's kitchen on most nights. I put myself at his mercy with the \"Menu D\u00e9gustation\" and thoroughly enjoyed the ride.\n\nMy first bite of food was their phenomenal amuse bouche, a crispy \"Pheasant Croquette\" with delightful strips of prosciutto and a mushy filling of minced meat mixed with gooey melted cheese, accompanied by a nutty \"Chilled Potato and Leek Soup with Sliced Almonds\" that tasted like the essence of leeks amplified by a thousand.\n\nMy favorite course of the evening was the earthy \"Roasted Tenderloin of Colorado Lamb,\" seasoned perfectly, cloud-tender, and served on a scorching hot plate (think Ruth's Chris). I don't mean to undersell the plump \"U-10 Day Boat Scallops,\" seared to pick up a brown crust and then placed on top of a buttery potato mousseline surrounded by a glorious jus de veau gravy. And what kind of grand meal (outside of California) would this be without a foie gras course? Here, a \"Saut\u00e9ed Foie Gras Steak\" is served with chocolate-stuffed Olson cherries in a silky green peppercorn sauce infused with more foie gras. The contrasting sweet, sour, savory, and spicy notes work to elevate this to a work of edible art congruent with the theme of the restaurant.\n\nService from my waiter was flawless, even if not as personalized as I've had in other Forbes 5-Star/AAA 5-Diamond spots. The supporting cast was excellent, however. The \"Bread Guy\" was perhaps the highlight, at one point scurrying out of the kitchen over to my table with agility and purpose to breathlessly announce to me, \"the 'Bacon and Onion Bread' is fresh from the oven.\" He understood me in a way that few other people ever have. I thought the \"Green Olive Bread\" was going to be the best thing he laid before me, but \"Bread Guy\" kept nudging me towards the baguette, even as I repeatedly passed it up. I finally succumbed and was rewarded for it with a crunchy, crackly crust, an interior both airy and lightly chewy, a perfect bit of salt, a pleasant amount of sweetness. Immediately upon my finishing it, he was at my side again to drop more bread on me. \"Bread Guy\" was awesome, even if he was diabolically trying to stuff me with bread until I exploded.\n\nDessert was Picasso's \"Warm Chocolate Fondant,\" a dish that has been on the menu every day since the restaurant opened, and rightly so. Yes, it's a chocolate lava cake, but the best you will ever have, and with a sphere of rocky road ice cream featuring massive melted marshmallows. In other words, the type of dessert that was made with me in mind. Shame I couldn't eat most of it due to being chock-full of bread.\n\nDespite serving me an excellent meal, I can't put Picasso in the same stratosphere as Restaurant Guy Savoy, MGM Grand's Jo\u00ebl Robuchon, and Twist by Pierre Gangiere (Vegas's trinity of \"A-tier\" restaurants).
